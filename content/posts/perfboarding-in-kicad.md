I strongly believe it is important to be able to prototype your electronic circuits without having to wait for a circuit board from some factory in China. When you are feeling inspired you should not wait, you sould start experimenting right away. There are many different prototyping methods you should master, where the right one depends on the complexity, operating frequency, voltage and current levels and many other considerations.

In this article I will scratch the surface of perfboard based circuits which are good for moderately complex circuits with relatively low frequency of operation and mostly through hole components.

## Perfboard types

## Adapterboards for SMD

## Example circuits
