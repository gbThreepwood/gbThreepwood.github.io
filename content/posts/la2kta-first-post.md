This is the first post I write on my new blog.

In colaboration with others I have had several blogs/websites in the past. Most notably https://www.switchcraft.org/ and https://www.haustveit.net/ which is still available, and http://home.c2i.net/haustveit which unfortunately is gone. This time I have decided to go for a statically generated website where I document some of my projects, as well as some projects I do in collaboration with others. I have decided to write in english, as I believe the content is mostly to niche to appeal to a lot of Norwegian readers.

In a time where artificially generated content is starting to dominate the internet, I hope to serve as a safe harbour or lagune where every content is self made, and every spelling mistake is my own.

My amateur radio callsign which I obtained in 2011 (specifially 14. April, I had to check :p) is LA2KTA, and shortly after that I bought the domain name la2kta.net and have been using it to access some of my private resources through the internet. Now I decided to also host my new blog under this domain.

I use the Hugo framework (https://gohugo.io/) and Emacs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and Org-mode for building the website, as well as a bunch of other design tools for the various electronic projects I do.
