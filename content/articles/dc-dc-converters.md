+++

DC/DC converters are electronic devices which converts a DC voltage and current from one level to another. They can be though of as transformers for DC, although they can also perform sophisticated roles which would be impossible with a old fasihoned transformer, and altough a transformer is sometimes a interal component of the DC/DC converter.

## Buck converter

The output voltage is thus given by:

\[
V_o = D \cdot V_d
\]

## Boost converter

## Buck-boost converter

## Flyback converter

## Forward converter
